#### Description

1. This script supports AMD64(x86-64) and ARM64(AArch64) architectures.
2. All users will be deleted, but the password of root will be preserved (if the root password is not set, it will be set to `distro2gentoo` ).
3. SSHD will auto start when boot, the listening port is 22, it can be connected by 'root' user with password authentication.
4. `/home`, `/root`, `/boot` and EFI partition mountpoint directories are preserved, all other normal directories will be deleted.
5. This script has no partition format actions.
6. The default kernel will be replaced with `sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin`, the initramfs will be generated by dracut.
7. The bootloader is GRUB2.
8. All actions won't affect the real system before the *'Following actions will affect the real system.'* log appears.
9. If you want to re-run this script before the real system affected, execute `umount -R /root.d2g.<arch>/*; rm -rf /root.d2g.<arch>` first.
